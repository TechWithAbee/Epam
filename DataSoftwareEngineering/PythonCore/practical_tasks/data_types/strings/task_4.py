# Data Types. Strings. Task 4
# Write a function that checks whether a string is a palindrome or not. The usage of any reversing functions is prohibited.

# To check your implementation you can use strings from here

# Examples:

# A dog! A panic in a pagoda!
# Do nine men Interpret? Nine men I nod
# T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad; I'd assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.
# A man, a plan, a canal â€” Panama!
