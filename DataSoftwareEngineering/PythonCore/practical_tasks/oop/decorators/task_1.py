# Description
# You need to create abstract class Vehicle. Classes Car, Motorcycle, Truck, Bus are inherited from Vehicle
# Class Vehicle accepts the following parameters:


# brand_name -> str (e.g. Honda)

# year_of_issue -> int (e.g. 2020)

# base_price -> int (e.g. 1_000_000)

# mileage -> int (e.g. 10_000)

# The following methods should be implemented:


# vehicle_type - returns str - type of the vehicle in the following pattern brand_name + name of the class.
# For example: Toyota Car, Suzuki Motorcycle;

# is_motorcycle return boolean value depends on the amount of wheels (2 wheels -> motorcycle, so method should return True);

# purchase_price - returns the price of the vehicle: (base_price - 0.1 * mileage). If the result price is less than 100_000,
# method should return 100_000.

# Put the following decorators where necessary and if it is necessary:
# abstractmethod, classmethod, staticmethod, property and other decorators.

# Example

# >>> vehicles = (
#     Car(brand_name="Toyota", year_of_issue=2020, base_price=1_000_000, mileage=150_000),
#     Motorcycle(brand_name="Suzuki", year_of_issue=2015, base_price=800_000, mileage=35_000),
#     Truck(brand_name="Scania", year_of_issue=2018, base_price=15_000_000, mileage=850_000),
#     Bus(brand_name="MAN", year_of_issue=2000, base_price=10_000_000, mileage=950_000)
# )

# >>> for vehicle in vehicles:
#         print(
#             f"Vehicle type={vehicle.vehicle_type()}\n"
#             f"Is motorcycle={vehicle.is_motorcycle()}\n"
#             f"Purchase price={vehicle.purchase_price}\n"
#         )


# Vehicle type=Toyota Car
# Is motorcycle=False
# Purchase price=985000.0

# Vehicle type=Suzuki Motorcycle
# Is motorcycle=True
# Purchase price=796500.0

# Vehicle type=Scania Truck
# Is motorcycle=False
# Purchase price=14915000.0

# Vehicle type=MAN Bus
# Is motorcycle=False
# Purchase price=9905000.0
